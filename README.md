# flutter_waveforms

A plugin that draw waveform, still a WIP, I'm struggling with [flutter_isolate](https://github.com/rmawatson/flutter_isolate/issues/25) that doesn't work on Android. I also think that using ffmpeg isn't the best way of getting data for waveform. I think that using c/c++ library with dart ffi or gettign directly the sound data with dart might be a better idea. Not sure if I'm going to spend more time on this project
